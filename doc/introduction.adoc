This simple application demonstrates:

- *modular front-end design*: the https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-io[client-side component] of the WebTextTerminal is installed from the npm repository.
The application also uses two other npm packages: a https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatpickr[date-picker] and a https://www.npmjs.com/package/table-builder[table builder].
The modules are bundled using https://webpack.js.org/[webpack].
- *handling input data*: the date-picker value is sent as _initData_ to the server-side link:javadoc/org/beryx/textio/web/example/ExampleApp.html[Text-IO runner].
- *handling output data*: the table data generated by the the server-side Text-IO runner is retrieved by the table-builder and rendered as a HTML table.
